# Day 1: My Coding Adventure Begins!

# Hey there, fellow coders! 🚀
# Today marks the beginning of my coding journey in college. I'm stoked!

# First, let's print a welcome message to the console.
print("Hello, World! 🌍")

# Next, I want to calculate the sum of the first 10 natural numbers.
total_sum = 0
for num in range(1, 11):
    total_sum += num

# Display the result.
print("The sum of the first 10 natural numbers is:", total_sum)

# Time for a quick break and a snack. Maybe a granola bar? 😄

# Now, let's write a function to check if a number is even or odd.
def check_even_odd(number):
    if number % 2 == 0:
        return "even"
    else:
        return "odd"

# Test the function with a couple of numbers.
num1 = 24
num2 = 17
print(num1, "is", check_even_odd(num1))
print(num2, "is", check_even_odd(num2))

# Phew, it's been a productive day of coding and learning. Can't wait for more challenges tomorrow!

# Signing off for now,
# [Your Name]
