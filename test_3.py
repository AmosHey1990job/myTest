# Day 3: Building Mini-Projects and Having Fun

# Hey coding buddies! ðŸŽ‰
# Another exciting day of coding exploration. Let's dive in!

# I've started working on a simple calculator app. Let's add two numbers.
def add_numbers(a, b):
    return a + b

# Test the calculator function.
num1 = 10
num2 = 7
print("The sum of", num1, "and", num2, "is:", add_numbers(num1, num2))

# It's snack time again. Anyone up for some pretzels? ðŸ¥¨

# Next, I'm creating a basic text-based game: Rock-Paper-Scissors.
player_choice = input("Enter your choice (rock/paper/scissors): ")

# The opponent's choice could be generated randomly, but let's keep it simple.
opponent_choice = "rock"

# Determine the winner.
if player_choice == opponent_choice:
    result = "It's a tie!"
elif player_choice == "rock" and opponent_choice == "scissors":
    result = "You win!"
else:
    result = "You lose!"

# Display the result.
print(result)

# Learning about functions has been mind-blowing. I'm starting to see how everything fits together.

# Alright, time to relax with some music before I call it a day. ðŸŽ¶

# Stay curious and keep coding,
