# Day 2: Diving Deeper into Coding Waters

# Hey fellow coders! 🖖
# Day 2 of college coding adventures, and I'm ready to learn more cool stuff.

# Let's start by defining a simple function to calculate the square of a number.
def calculate_square(number):
    return number ** 2

# Test the function with a few numbers.
num1 = 5
num2 = 8
print("The square of", num1, "is", calculate_square(num1))
print("The square of", num2, "is", calculate_square(num2))

# Time for a coffee break! ☕️ Gotta stay caffeinated for coding.

# Now, let's work with lists. I'm creating a list of my favorite fruits.
favorite_fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange", "grapes", "strawberry"]

# Print each fruit using a loop.
print("My favorite fruits:")
for fruit in favorite_fruits:
    print("- " + fruit)

# Oh, and I'm learning about version control! I just committed my changes to Git.
# It feels so pro. 💪

# Wrapping up for now. Looking forward to more coding discoveries tomorrow!

# Happy coding,
# [Your Name]
